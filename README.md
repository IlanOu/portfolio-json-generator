# JSON Generator for My Portfolio

This simple tool lets me easily create JSON files to enrich my online portfolio. It's particularly useful when I want to display projects with various media such as images and videos.

## Features

- Quickly create JSON files for each project.
- Generate an image gallery with preview.
- Add video links for dynamic presentation.
- User-friendly interface.

## How to use

1. Fill in the form with your project details.
2. Add images and/or video links to illustrate your work.
3. Click on "Submit" to generate the JSON file corresponding to your project.

## How to integrate JSON into your portfolio

1. Copy the generated JSON.
2. Paste it on Github in the [gh-pages] branch (https://github.com/IlanOu/portfolio/tree/gh-pages).

## Example of Generated JSON

```json
{
  "projectId": 1,
  "version": 1,
  "projectName": "Project Name",
  "description": "Detailed description of the project.",
  "imageUrls": [
    "https://url.to.a/great/image",
    "https://url.to.another/greate/image"
  ],
  "videoUrls": [
